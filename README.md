Hello, I’m @Keirrak!

I’m interested in all thing ML but focus on NLP because the complexity of human language fascinates me. 
With an image there’s a finite answer, everything either is or is not a duck! Human language on the other hand will take you down a deep rabbit hole of innuendos. 

My current rabbit hole aligns with my interests, I’m learning how to assess risk via subject matter expert reports and, when I can, social media. 
This goes beyond identifying toxic comments to learning the precursors to pulling a Sarah Palin. (That’s “Going Rogue” for those of you that have no idea about a Sarah Palin. For those who are politically astute, pick your poison on either book!)
